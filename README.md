# MCtop
Monte Carlo program for production and decay of Unstable tops

This fortran program computes 8 event shape distributions from the decay products of a pair of quarks top and anti-top. Tops are produced
in e+e- collisions at tree-level, and decay in the narrow width approximation.

One can consider top decaying into 2 particles (W + b), or 3 particles (W + b, followed by W -> massless pair). W's are produced on-shell
and decay later in the narrow width approximation.

One can neglect spin correlations, or can include spin correlations within a given hemisphere, or the complete correlations.
